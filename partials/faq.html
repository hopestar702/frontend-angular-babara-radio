                        <h3>Future plans for radio-browser</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="panel-body">
                        There are plans to improve radio-browser even further. These are just the biggest things on my
                        mind. More are on the
                        issue pages on GitHub and there is also the place where you can add your ideas and discuss them
                        with others. The main goal of radio-browser was always and will always be to make it as
                        AUTOMATIC
                        and as SIMPLE to use and as OPEN as possible. If there is a sensible way to make it automatic
                        then we should
                        at least think about it. With this in mind the following points should give you an idea about
                        the main direction of the project.
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Short term</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Extract more meta information from stream (country, language, ...). A good
                                        starting point would be <a
                                            href="https://www.stream-meta.info/">www.stream-meta.info</a>. This should
                                        then be used to allow
                                        stream owners to override information in the database for their own streams.
                                        They know best what their own streams are, where they are located, what the
                                        language spoken is etc..
                                        This just extends an already existing way of providing metainformation.
                                        Overriding database information will be an opt-in for stream owners. This is
                                        because
                                        at the moment a lot of streams do have wrong or empty metainformation fields.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Automatically delete streams that have the same link or do have the same
                                        resolved link to
                                        clean up the database. Always keep the oldest one to ensure that it is not
                                        possible
                                        to circumvent the edit-block for streams.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                        </dl>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Mid term</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Promote adding of more meta information to the streams out there so they can be
                                        updated from the stream owners themselves. Document how to add metainformation
                                        on software that stream owners use.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>To make this easier for them it should also be
                                        promoted to software
                                        projects for streaming audio and video (like icecast, shoutcast) to add more
                                        metainformation fields (like language, country, ..).
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                        </dl>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Long term</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>It should be easier to add streams to the list just by adding the webpage of the
                                        stream. The idea is that
                                        radio-browser should act more like a web-crawler than now by searching a given
                                        web page for usable streams.
                                        This would make it much easier for users who do not know what stream urls are to
                                        add them to the database.</li>

                                    <li>Legal restrictions:
                                        <br /> There may be some countries which have legal restrictions prohibiting
                                        your favorite
                                        stations from broadcasting worldwide. It has to be possible to connect to them
                                        from my server
                                        located in Germany.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>High Costs:
                                        <br /> Some others would allow global broadcast but let the stations pay huge
                                        amounts of money to
                                        copyright owners if they want to do that. Please talk to your station or your
                                        local political
                                        representatives to ensure the freedom of global
                                        broadcasting.

                                    <li>Status not up to date:<br />
                                        Sometimes streams go down for some time. If the automatic check happens to be
                                        there at this exact
                                        time, they will be marked as broken. It will take some time that this station is
                                        checked again and
                                        marked
                                        as usable.

                                You have to do the following steps:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Do a DNS lookup of all.api.radio-browser.info for all IP addresses. It will
                                        always return all
                                        available first level servers.</li>
                                    <li>Filter out doubles</li>
                                    <li>Do a reverse lookup for all remaining IPs.</li>
                                    <li>Add "https://" in front of each of them.</li>
                                    <li>Randomize the list and choose the first one as base url. If a request fails
                                        continue to the next server in your list.</li>
                                </ol>
                                This steps will ensure that the users of your app will always have a working connection
                                to a server.

                                which powers the new first level servers. It will automatically mirror the main
                                servers because it supports federation. This is probably your easiest bet.

                                does have federation.<br />
                                This means that changes on one server will automatically be pulled from all the other
                                servers and incorporated into their data. Consistency is kept by giving each change a
                                distinct
                                unique ID (<a

                                Every server keeps a station change history including all additions and changes.
                                This can be pulled from other servers as a full version or as a differential from the
                                state they already have.
                                Each server also keeps a history of station checks, which can also be pulled in a
                                similiar fashion.<br /><br />
                                Some servers do checks themselves, so there are multiple sources of checks from
                                different countries. Checks from multiple sources
                                for one station are combined into a majority vote (offline/online) state.
