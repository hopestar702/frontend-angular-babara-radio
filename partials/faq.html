    <H3>Automatic station check</H3>
    <dl>
        <dt>How often is every station checked?</dt>
        <dd>It depends on the overall number of stations in the database and if the station is currently marked as broken. Currently a cron job is run every 10 minutes which checks 50 working stations and 10 broken stations.</dd>
        <dt>In what order are the stations checked?</dt>
        <dd>The stations, that were not checked for the longest time are checked first.</dd>
        <dt>Why are some stations marked as broken even when they are not?</dt>
        <dd>This can have multiple causes:
            <ul>
                <li>Legal restrictions:
                    <br/> There may be some countries which have legal restrictions, that prohibit your favourite station to broadcast worldwide. It has to be possible to connect to it from my server which is located in Germany.
                </li>
                <li>High Costs:
                    <br/> Some others would allow global broadcast but let the stations pay a huge amounts of money to copyright owners if they want to do that. Please talk to your station or your local political representative to ensure the freedom of global
                    broadcasting.
                </li>
                <li>Status not up to date:<br/>
                  Sometimes streams go down for some time. If the automatic check happens to be there at this exact time it will marked as broken. It will take some time that this station is checked again and marked as usable.
                </li>
                <li>Bugs:
                    <br/> My program has a BUG :) If you think that is the case, please drop me a note or if you are a programmer fix it on github.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
