    <H3>Automatic station check</H3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Why is my click not counted?</dt>
        <dd>Only one click per IP address per station a day is counted. Some people click their favorite stations
            hundreds of times every day by using the programmers API, so I had to add this restriction.
            IP addresses that did the click are kept for this purpose for 24 hours.
        </dd>
        <dt>How often is every station checked?</dt>
        <dd>Every station is checked once every 24 hours. 
        </dd>
        <dt>In what order are the stations checked?</dt>
        <dd>The stations not checked for the longest time are checked first.</dd>
        <dt>Why are some stations marked as broken even when they are not?</dt>
        <dd>This can have multiple causes:
            <ul>
                <li>Legal restrictions:
                    <br/> There may be some countries which have legal restrictions prohibiting your favorite
                    stations from broadcasting worldwide. It has to be possible to connect to them from my server
                    located in Germany.
                </li>
                <li>High Costs:
                    <br/> Some others would allow global broadcast but let the stations pay huge amounts of money to
                    copyright owners if they want to do that. Please talk to your station or your local political
                    representatives to ensure the freedom of global
                    broadcasting.
                </li>
                <li>Status not up to date:<br/>
                    Sometimes streams go down for some time. If the automatic check happens to be there at this exact
                    time, they will be marked as broken. It will take some time that this station is checked again and marked
                    as usable.
                </li>
                <li>Bugs:
                    <br/> My program has a BUG :) If you think that is the case, please drop me a note or if you are a
                    programmer, fix it on GitHub.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>When will stations get deleted?</dt>
        <dd>There are two cases in which stations will get deleted automatically:
            <ul>
                <li>New stations that never worked will get deleted after 2 days.</li>
                <li>Stations that worked at some point, but have not been working for at least 6 days now will get deleted.</li>
            </ul>

        <dd>
            It is completely free. Free as in Beer/chocolate :)<br/>
            Just go to <a href="https://www.radio-browser.info/webservice">www.radio-browser.info</a></li> and read the docs. It is easy and has examples.

        <dt>How do I get a list of second level servers?</dt>
        <dd>
            You have to do the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Do a DNS lookup of all.api.radio-browser.info for all IP addresses. It will always return all available second level servers.</li>
                <li>Filter out doubles</li>
                <li>Do a reverse lookup for all remaining IPs.</li>
                <li>Add "https://" in front of each of them.</li>
            </ol>
            There are example implementations at <a href="https://api.radio-browser.info">api.radio-browser.info</a>.

        <dt>I want to set up my own radiobrowser API server. How do I do that?</dt>
        <dd>
            You have two ways:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    DEPRECATED:
                    Use the old variant which is for now in use at www.radio-browser.info:<br/>
                    There is a README at <a href="https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api">radiobrowser-api</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the new system at <a href="https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api-rust">radiobrowser-api-rust</a> which
                    powers the new second level servers. It will automatically mirror the main server because it supports federation. This
                    is probably your easiest bet.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>

    <dl>
        <dt>Does radio-browser have some kinds of federation network?</dt>
        <dd>
            The new API <a href="https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api-rust">radiobrowser-api-rust</a> does have federation.<br/>
            The old one <a href="https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api">radiobrowser-api</a> does not.

        <dt>What is the future plan for www.radio-browser.info?</dt>
        <dd>
            <u>Current State</u><br/>
            At the moment www.radio-browser.info/webservice is the only first level server handling most users.<br/>
            There are some second level servers which already use the new style API and use federation to mirror the contents of the first level server.<br/>
            For now stations are distributed from the first level server to the second level servers and NOT in the other direction.
            That means stations added to second level servers will not get distributed and will be deleted eventually.<br/><br/>
            <u>Future</u><br/>
            The server at www.radio-browser.info/webservice will be shut down eventually and the current second level servers
            will become the first level servers for other people to use and mirror.<br/>
            Stations can be added to any one of the new first level servers and will be distributed among them.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt>How does federation work?</dt>
        <dd>
            Every server keeps a station change history including all additions and changes.
            This can be pulled from other servers as a full version or as a differential from the state they already have.
            Each server also keeps a history of station checks, which can also be pulled in a similiar fashion.<br/><br/>
            Some servers do checks themselves, so there are multiple sources of checks from different countries. Checks from multiple sources
            for one station are combined into a majority vote (offline/online) state.
