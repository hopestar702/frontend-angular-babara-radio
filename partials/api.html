    <H2>HowTo</H2>
    These steps should be done in your APP or program.
    <ol>
        <li>
            <H3>Get a list of available servers</H3>
            Do a DNS-lookup of 'all.api.radio-browser.info'. This gives you a list of all available servers.<br />
            To get the nice names you can do a reverse DNS-Lookup of the entries from the first request and display them
            to the user.<br />
            There are some examples of how to do this in different languages: <a href="serverlist.js">NodeJS</a>, <a
                href="serverlist.py">Python</a>, <a href="serverlist.java">Java (Android)</a><br />
            Now you have a list of multiple names of servers which you can use to directly connect to with HTTP and
            preferably HTTPS.<br />
            Example: https://de1.api.radio-browser.info, https://de2.api.radio-browser.info, ..
        </li>
        <li>
            <H3>Choose an entry from the list</H3>
            Either let the user choose one server from the list with a dialog or<br />
            just choose a random one. It is a good idea to check the choosen one with a simple status request to
            "/stats" if it still works.
        </li>
        <li>
            <H3>Continue with the docs of the server</H3>
            I try to keep them all at the same version, so they should always all be the same.<br />
            Here are some examples of working servers:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://de1.api.radio-browser.info">https://de1.api.radio-browser.info</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://fr1.api.radio-browser.info">https://fr1.api.radio-browser.info</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://nl1.api.radio-browser.info">https://nl1.api.radio-browser.info</a></li>
            </ul>
            Click the links to find out about the API.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <H2>Notice</H2>
    <p>
        Users of the old API (SERVER = www.radio-browser.info) should migrate to the new one. It uses
        a newer server software, which is actively maintained and which is faster. Please follow the documentation
        bellow.
        <br /><br />
        <b>I am still using the old API, what should I do?</b>
        <br />
        There are only a few minor changes in the api. Most things can be kept the same.
        <ol>
            <li>Do NOT use the "id" fields anymore! They do not work accross multiple servers. Use the uuid fields
                instead (e.g.: stationuuid, checkuuid, clickuuid). These fields are kept consistend accross servers in
                the network.
                If you still use id fields to for example keep a favourite station list please change this behaviour as
                soon as posible.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the JSON some fields that were previously strings, are now numbers or bools. Please visit the docs
                for that.
            </li>
            <li>
                Never use a direct link to a single new server. It is much better to get a list of the servers like
                described above. Available server names may change.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
